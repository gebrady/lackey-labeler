    "# PoCoPet Labeler for XRF Beads with a graphical user interface\n",
    "### With the amount of XRF glass and samples generated in the Pomona lab, it would be helpful to increase efficiency in label creation using a tabular format. Currently, data are entered into Microsoft Word files one line at a time by hand, creating opportunities for human error in data entry and general slowness. Expediting the data entry through an automated method ensures accurate data transfer from field notes, chemical databases, and other sources of stored information. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Although the data we gather and notate in the Pomona lab generally require a human to intiate their presence in catalogs, we can minimize the amount of times these data are transferred by hand to decrease the potential for accidental skewing and errors. Likewise, data entry in a tabular format like Excel better allows the user to follow along with their data, i.e. match consistency among attributes of the same type, see the entire catalog in one view, or directly import columns of data from existing archives of chemical or descriptive data; on the other hand, entering data line-by-line, cell-by-cell in a word document prohibits checks in consistency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Thus, the following packages were developed to streamline the process from data table to table of labels. The following workflow is carried out: \n",
    "\n",
    "##### (1) Tabular data are uploaded\n",
    "##### (2) Unique suites contained in the data are identified and enumerated\n",
    "##### (3) User selects colors for each suite in the data\n",
    "##### (4) User-given attributes are used alongside the tabular data table to populate a Word template.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lastly, the use of a graphical user interface encourages petrologists, geologists, etc. of any coding ability to operate this beta-level software. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Disclaimer: While the code runs smoothly and has been tested many times, the author has not corroborated efficiency with other developers to create a vastly applicable code with many features. Potential updates to the design are written in the code files as comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### __RULES__: Data must have at least the same columns as the template data (additional columns are fine, but as of now only the matching names will be used to populated the data table)\n",
    "### You must restart the whole app to upload a different data table or to create multiple labels for multiple files."
